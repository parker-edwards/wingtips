# Wingtips Changelog / Release Notes

All notable changes to `Wingtips` will be documented in this file. `Wingtips` adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## Why pre-1.0 releases?

Wingtips is used heavily and is stable internally at Nike, however the wider community may have needs or use cases that we haven't considered. Therefore Wingtips will live at a sub-1.0 version for a short time after its initial open source release to give it time to respond quickly to the open source community without ballooning the version numbers. Once its public APIs have stabilized again as an open source project it will be switched to the normal post-1.0 semantic versioning system.

## [0.19.0](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/wingtips/releases/tag/wingtips-v0.19.0)

Released on 2019-04-24.

### Added

* Added a `WingtipsToLightStepLifecycleListener` for sending Wingtips spans to LightStep satellites for ingestion. 
    - Added by [Parker Edwards][contrib_parkeredwards] and [Nic Munroe][contrib_nicmunroe] in pull requests 
    [#89](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/wingtips/pull/89) and [#90](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/wingtips/pull/90).

### Fixed

* Optimized the ID sanitization logic done by `WingtipsToZipkinSpanConverterDefaultImpl` and
`WingtipsToLightStepLifecycleListener` for speed/performance. If you receive a heavy volume of traffic with IDs that
need to be sanitized, then this change should significantly reduce the CPU hit caused by sanitization.
    - Fixed by [Nic Munroe][contrib_nicmunroe] in pull request [#91](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/wingtips/pull/91).

## [0.18.1](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/wingtips/releases/tag/wingtips-v0.18.1)

Released on 2018-11-06.

### Fixed

* Fixed Span key/value serialization format so that it will now unicode-escape any commas it finds in tag keys. This
is in addition to spaces and equals signs, which it was already unicode-escaping for tag keys. This is necessary
to facilitate programmatic parsing of Spans serialized in key/value format, since commas that are not surrounded by
quotes (i.e. not part of a value) are a special character that separates key/value pairs, and tag keys are not 
surrounded by quotes. 
    - Fixed by [Nic Munroe][contrib_nicmunroe] in pull request [#86](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/wingtips/pull/86).

## [0.18.0](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/wingtips/releases/tag/wingtips-v0.18.0)

Released on 2018-11-02.

### Fixed

* Fixed a bug that could cause a child span to sometimes inherit the tags of its parent.
    - Fixed by [Nic Munroe][contrib_nicmunroe] in pull request [#84](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/wingtips/pull/84).

### Added

* Added the ability to add custom timestamped annotations to Spans. See the 
[Custom Timestamped Span Annotations](README.md#custom_annotations) section of the readme for details.
    - Added by [Nic Munroe][contrib_nicmunroe] in pull request [#84](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/wingtips/pull/84).
    - Resolves issue [#23](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/wingtips/issues/23) (along with the changes from Wingtips
    version `0.16.0`).
* Added Wingtips annotations to Zipkin spans when utilizing the Wingtips -> Zipkin functionality found in
`wingtips-zipkin2` module (and the deprecated `wingtips-zipkin`). 
    - Added by [Nic Munroe][contrib_nicmunroe] in pull request [#84](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/wingtips/pull/84).

## [0.17.0](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/wingtips/releases/tag/wingtips-v0.17.0)

Released on 2018-10-30.

### Added

* Added automatic Span tagging to HTTP server and client Wingtips instrumentation. 
    - Affects Servlet instrumentation (`RequestTracingFilter`), Apache HttpClient instrumentation 
    (`WingtipsHttpClientBuilder` and `WingtipsApacheHttpClientInterceptor`), and Spring RestTemplate HTTP client 
    instrumentation (`WingtipsClientHttpRequestInterceptor` and `WingtipsAsyncClientHttpRequestInterceptor`). 
    - By default Zipkin tags and conventions are used (`ZipkinHttpTagStrategy`), however you can provide different
    strategies and adapters if needed.
    - Added by [Brandon Currie][contrib_brandoncurrie] and [Nic Munroe][contrib_nicmunroe] in pull requests 
    [#81](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/wingtips/pull/81) and [#82](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/wingtips/pull/82).     
    - Resolves issue [#21](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/wingtips/issues/21).
    
### Changed

* Changed the default span name format for HTTP instrumentation (Servlet, Spring, and Apache) to follow Zipkin
conventions. In particular, Span names no longer include the full URL. This is because visualization and analytics 
systems like Zipkin parse the span names in order to identify different logical endpoints, but the full URL can be 
high cardinality due to unique IDs or query strings (`http://.../some/path/12345?foo=bar67890`), even though they 
logically point to the same HTTP endpoint (`http://.../some/path/{id}`). Instead, span names now follow the Zipkin 
convention of `HTTP_METHOD /http/route`, where the HTTP route is the low-cardinality URL "template" that logically 
identifies the endpoint, e.g.: `GET /foo/bar/{id}`. The full path and/or URL can be found in the span tags now, 
instead of the span name. Note that the HTTP route/path template is not available for all frameworks and libraries. 
In those cases the span name will simply be: `HTTP_METHOD` (you'll still be able to extract the full path/URL from the 
span tags).  
    - Changed by [Nic Munroe][contrib_nicmunroe] in pull request [#82](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/wingtips/pull/82). 


### Breaking Changes

* The span name format change (described above) is breaking if you were relying on seeing the full URL/path in the span 
name for any reason, i.e. automated parsing.

Code-level breaking changes:

* The `getSubspanSpanName()` method signature for several classes was adjusted to take in two new args for the
span-tag-and-naming strategy and adapter. Classes affected: (Apache) `WingtipsApacheHttpClientInterceptor`, (Apache) 
`WingtipsHttpClientBuilder`, (Spring) `WingtipsClientHttpRequestInterceptor`, and (Spring) 
`WingtipsAsyncClientHttpRequestInterceptor`.
* `WingtipsApacheHttpClientUtil.getSubspanSpanName()` changed to `getFallbackSubspanSpanName()` to better reflect its
purpose as a fallback rather than primary span namer.
* `HttpRequestTracingUtils.getSubspanSpanNameForHttpRequest()` changed to `generateSafeSpanName()` with adjusted
arguments to match the new span naming format.
* `RequestTracingFilter.setupTracingCompletionWhenAsyncRequestCompletes(...)` method signature adjusted to also take 
in the response and span-tag-and-naming strategy and adapter. Same with 
`ServletRuntime.setupTracingCompletionWhenAsyncRequestCompletes(...)`.
* `WingtipsRequestSpanCompletionAsyncListener.completeRequestSpan(...)` method signature adjusted to take `AsyncEvent`
arg.

Most of the breaking changes are to protected methods or methods that aren't likely to be used by end-users, so
these code-level breaking changes should hopefully be invisible to many (most?) Wingtips users. 
   

## [0.16.0](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/wingtips/releases/tag/wingtips-v0.16.0)

Released on 2018-08-28.

### Added

- Added initial support for tagging `Span`s with key/value pairs. These will be included in `Span.toKeyValueString()` 
and `Span.toJSON()` output, so you will see tags when `Tracer` logs `Span`s. These tags are now also sent to Zipkin
when using `WingtipsToZipkinLifecycleListener`. You can take advantage of known Zipkin and/or OpenTracing tag
constants via `KnownZipkinTags` and `KnownOpenTracingTags`. `Span` serialization and deserialization logic (both for
key/value format and JSON format) has been moved to a new `SpanParser` class, so some of the parsing-related methods
and constants that were in `Span` have been deprecated (but not yet removed) in favor of moving to `SpanParser`.
Some more details about tags can be found in the [main readme](README.md#span_tags). NOTE: timestamped annotations
are not yet implemented, and neither has server/client instrumentation been updated to take advantage of tags
(i.e. automatically tagging spans with `http.method`, `http.path`, `http.status_code`, `error`, etc). Those features
and functionality will come later. 
    - Added by [Brandon Currie][contrib_brandoncurrie] and [Nic Munroe][contrib_nicmunroe] in pull requests 
    [#74](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/wingtips/pull/74) and [#78](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/wingtips/pull/78). 
    - Partially resolves issue [#23](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/wingtips/issues/23).
- `wingtips-zipkin2`'s `WingtipsToZipkinSpanConverterDefaultImpl` now has an alternate constructor that sets it up
to "sanitize" IDs (Trace IDs, Span IDs, Parent Span IDs) that aren't Zipkin compatible. This can be necessary when
you are reporting spans from Wingtips to Zipkin via `WingtipsToZipkinLifecycleListener`, but callers into your system
are not sending IDs that conform to the Zipkin B3 spec. When a non-Zipkin-compatible ID is detected and you've 
configured `WingtipsToZipkinSpanConverterDefaultImpl` to sanitize, then the invalid IDs will be converted to valid IDs
in a deterministic way, a correlation log message will be output, and the original bad IDs will be sent to Zipkin as
tags on the span: `invalid.trace_id`, `invalid.span_id`. and/or `invalid.parent_id`. This sanitization feature is
*not* turned on by default - you must explicitly opt-in by creating the span converter using the alternate constructor.
See `WingtipsToZipkinSpanConverterDefaultImpl` for more details.
    - Added by [Long Ton That][contrib_longtonthat] and [Nic Munroe][contrib_nicmunroe] in pull requests 
    [#73](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/wingtips/pull/73) and [#77](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/wingtips/pull/77). 
- `wingtips-zipkin2-spring-boot`'s `WingtipsWithZipkinSpringBootConfiguration` now allows you to override the 
`WingtipsToZipkinSpanConverter` that is used when converting Wingtips spans to Zipkin spans for reporting to Zipkin.
This is accomplished via a `@Bean` that exposes the `WingtipsToZipkinSpanConverter` impl you want used. See the 
[wingtips-zipkin2-spring-boot readme](wingtips-zipkin2-spring-boot#overriding-the-default-wingtipstozipkinspanconverter)
for details.
    - Added by [Long Ton That][contrib_longtonthat] in pull requests [#75](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/wingtips/pull/75)
    and [#76](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/wingtips/pull/76).
    
### Fixed

- Fixed issues around value-escaping when serializing spans to string using `Span.toKeyValueString()` and 
`Span.toJSON()`. For key/value format and JSON format, values are now escaped using minimal JSON-escaping rules.
See [RFC 7159 Section 7](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7159#section-7) for full details on these rules, but in 
particular note that we are only escaping the bare minimum required characters: quotation mark, reverse solidus 
(backslash), and the control characters (U+0000 through U+001F). Additionally, for key/value format we are now 
surrounding all values with quotes, i.e. `some_key="some JSON-escaped value"`.
    - Fixed by [Brandon Currie][contrib_brandoncurrie] and [Nic Munroe][contrib_nicmunroe] as part of pull requests 
    [#74](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/wingtips/pull/74) and [#78](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/wingtips/pull/78). 

## [0.15.0](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/wingtips/releases/tag/wingtips-v0.15.0)

Released on 2018-07-14.

### Added

- Added [`wingtips-zipkin2`](wingtips-zipkin2) and [`wingtips-zipkin2-spring-boot`](wingtips-zipkin2-spring-boot) 
modules. These serve the same purpose as `wingtips-zipkin` and `wingtips-zipkin-spring-boot` but support the Zipkin 2 
API and span format. You can still send span data to Zipkin 1 API / span format servers with these new modules, so 
they are full replacements and the old modules are now deprecated.
    - Fixed by [Adrian Cole][contrib_adriancole] and [Nic Munroe][contrib_nicmunroe] in pull requests 
    [#69](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/wingtips/pull/69) and [#70](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/wingtips/pull/70).
    For issue [#68](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/wingtips/issues/68). 

### Changed

- Changed the Wingtips Spring, Spring Boot, and Apache HttpClient related modules to no longer export Spring, 
Spring Boot, or Apache HttpClient dependencies. These Wingtips modules aren't likely to be used in an environment
where those dependencies are missing, and this change avoids the Wingtips modules causing version conflicts with
whatever Spring, Spring Boot, or Apache HttpClient version your project is already using. The readmes for these
Wingtips modules have more details in case you were somehow relying on the transitive dependencies.
    - Changed by [Nic Munroe][contrib_nicmunroe] in pull request [#71](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/wingtips/pull/71).

### Deprecated

- Deprecated the [`wingtips-zipkin`](wingtips-zipkin) and [`wingtips-zipkin-spring-boot`](wingtips-zipkin-spring-boot) 
modules in favor of the new [`wingtips-zipkin2`](wingtips-zipkin2) and 
[`wingtips-zipkin2-spring-boot`](wingtips-zipkin2-spring-boot) modules. See the old modules' readmes for deprecation 
and migration details and the new modules' readmes for usage info.
    - Deprecated by [Nic Munroe][contrib_nicmunroe] in pull request [#70](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/wingtips/pull/70).

### Project Build

- Upgraded to Gradle `4.8`.
    - Done by [Adrian Cole][contrib_adriancole] in pull request [#67](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/wingtips/pull/67).
    
## [0.14.2](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/wingtips/releases/tag/wingtips-v0.14.2)

Released on 2018-03-22.

### Changed

- Changed `Span` to implement `Closeable` instead of `AutoCloseable`. `Closeable` extends `AutoCloseable` and the
`Span.close()` method signature did not change, so this has no effect other than to enable using `Span`s with code
that requires a `Closeable`. For example, after this change `Span`s can now be used with Apache Commons 
`IOUtils.closeQuietly(span)`.
    - Fixed by [Nic Munroe][contrib_nicmunroe] in pull request [#65](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/wingtips/pull/65).
    For issue [#64](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/wingtips/issues/64). 

## [0.14.1](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/wingtips/releases/tag/wingtips-v0.14.1)

Released on 2017-11-14.

### Fixed

- Fixed `WingtipsSpringBootProperties` and `WingtipsZipkinProperties` to not be a Spring `@Component`. This was causing
multiple-bean-definition errors when component scanning those classes. Those springboot autoconfig classes now work
when component scanning or when manually imported into an application.
    - Fixed by [Nic Munroe][contrib_nicmunroe] in pull request [#61](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/wingtips/pull/61).
- Fixed `WingtipsSpringBootConfiguration` to set `RequestTracingFilter` to the highest precedence so that it will
execute as the first Servlet filter, since overall-request-spans should encompass as much of the request as possible.
    - Fixed by [Nic Munroe][contrib_nicmunroe] in pull request [#62](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/wingtips/pull/62).
    
## [0.14.0](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/wingtips/releases/tag/wingtips-v0.14.0)

Released on 2017-11-06.

### Added

- Added `ExecutorServiceWithTracing` to automate having tracing state hop threads when using `Executor` or 
`ExecutorService` to do work on async threads. See the 
[async section of the main readme](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/wingtips#async_usage), the 
[readme for the Java 8 module](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/wingtips/tree/master/wingtips-java8), or the javadocs on 
`ExecutorServiceWithTracing` for usage examples. 
    - Added by [Nic Munroe][contrib_nicmunroe] in pull request [#58](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/wingtips/pull/58).
    
### Removed

- Removed the "auto resurrect tracing state from SLF4J MDC" behavior from `Tracer` when the tracing state doesn't exist 
in `Tracer` explicitly. This was possible with some SLF4J implementations where MDC state is inherited by child threads,
however this could cause spans to hop threads when you don't want them to (e.g. long-lived background threads). We now 
have helper classes and methods for explicitly and intentionally hopping threads in a way that isn't surprising like 
the MDC auto-resurrect behavior so those features should be used instead for async thread-hopping. Note that this 
brings Wingtips in line with Logback, which also intentionally removed the "MDC inheritance in child thread" behavior 
for similar reasons (see the Logback version 1.1.5 notes in the [logback changelog](https://logback.qos.ch/news.html)). 
For Wingtips users that relied on this auto-resurrection-from-MDC behavior in Wingtips please refer to the
[async section of the main readme](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/wingtips#async_usage) and/or the
[readme for the Java 8 module](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/wingtips/tree/master/wingtips-java8) for information on 
explicitly and intentionally causing tracing state to hop threads.
    - Removed by [Nic Munroe][contrib_nicmunroe] in pull request [#57](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/wingtips/pull/57).    
    
## [0.13.0](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/wingtips/releases/tag/wingtips-v0.13.0)

Released on 2017-10-25.

### Added

- Added support for Spring and Spring Boot projects, both on the incoming-request side and 
propagating-tracing-downstream side (via Spring's `RestTemplate` HTTP client). Please see the readmes for the 
[wingtips-spring](wingtips-spring/), [wingtips-spring-boot](wingtips-spring-boot/), and 
[wingtips-zipkin-spring-boot](wingtips-zipkin-spring-boot/) modules for details and usage examples.
    - Added by [Aleš Justin][contrib_alesj] in pull request [#37](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/wingtips/pull/37)
    - and by [Nic Munroe][contrib_nicmunroe] in pull request [#51](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/wingtips/pull/51).
- Added support for the Apache HTTP Client. See the [wingtips-apache-http-client](wingtips-apache-http-client/)
module readme for details and usage examples.
    - Added by [Nic Munroe][contrib_nicmunroe] in pull request [#53](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/wingtips/pull/53).  

### Fixed

- Fixed `RequestTracingFilter` to work properly for both Servlet 2.x and Servlet 3+ environments. Part of this fix 
includes *not* exposing Servlet API as a transitive dependency of the `wingtips-servlet-api` module. This means you may 
need to pull in the Servlet API into your project if it's not already there, although it is usually provided by your 
Servlet container. See the
["Servlet API dependency required at runtime"](wingtips-servlet-api/README.md#servlet_api_required_at_runtime) section
of the `wingtips-servlet-api` readme for details.
    - Fixed by [woldie][contrib_woldie] in pull request [#48](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/wingtips/pull/48)
    - and by [Nic Munroe][contrib_nicmunroe] in pull requests [#49](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/wingtips/pull/49) and
    [#52](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/wingtips/pull/52)
    - and with help from [Adrian Cole][contrib_adriancole], in particular some comments in pull request 
    [#49](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/wingtips/pull/49) that pointed us at the 
    [ServletRuntime](https://github.com/openzipkin/brave/blob/master/instrumentation/servlet/src/main/java/brave/servlet/ServletRuntime.java)
    class from [Brave](https://github.com/openzipkin/brave). 
    
## [0.12.1](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/wingtips/releases/tag/wingtips-v0.12.1)

Released on 2017-09-27.

### Fixed

- Fixed `RequestTracingFilter` to work properly with async servlet requests. Previously the overall request span was
completing instantly when the endpoint method returned rather than waiting for the async request to finish. Tests have
been added that execute against a real running Jetty server equipped with `RequestTracingFilter` and several different
types of servlet endpoints - these tests prevent regression and verify proper Wingtips behavior for the following use 
cases: synchronous/blocking servlet, async servlet, blocking-forwarded servlet (using the request dispatcher to forward 
the request to a different blocking servlet), async-forwarded servlet (using the `AsyncContext.dispatch(...)` method to 
forward the request to a different async servlet), and an async servlet that errors-out due to hitting its request 
timeout.   
    - Fixed by [Nic Munroe][contrib_nicmunroe] in pull request [#42](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/wingtips/pull/42). 
    
### Deprecated

- With the fixes to `RequestTracingFilter`, several methods and classes are no longer needed and have been marked 
`@Deprecated`. They will be removed in a future update. Full deprecation/migration instructions are in the `@deprecated` 
javadocs, but here is a short list:
    - `RequestTracingFilterNoAsync` class - this class is no longer needed since `RequestTracingFilter` is no longer
    abstract. Move to using `RequestTracingFilter` directly.
    - `RequestTracingFilter.isAsyncDispatch(HttpServletRequest)` method - this method is no longer needed or used by 
    `RequestTracingFilter`. It remains to prevent breaking subclasses that overrode it, but it will not be used. 
    - `RequestTracingFilter.ERROR_REQUEST_URI_ATTRIBUTE` field - this field is no longer used. If you still need it for
    some reason you can refer to `javax.servlet.RequestDispatcher.ERROR_REQUEST_URI` instead.   
    - Deprecated by [Nic Munroe][contrib_nicmunroe] in pull request [#42](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/wingtips/pull/42).

### Added

- [Added a warning to the readme](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/wingtips#try_with_resources_warning) about error handling 
and potentially confusing/non-obvious behavior when autoclosing `Span`s with `try-with-resources` statements.
    - Added by [Nic Munroe][contrib_nicmunroe] in pull request [#43](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/wingtips/pull/43).
- Added several sample applications that show how Wingtips works in various frameworks and use cases. See their 
respective readmes for more information:
    - [samples/sample-jersey1](samples/sample-jersey1/)
    - [samples/sample-jersey2](samples/sample-jersey2/)
    - [samples/sample-spring-web-mvc](samples/sample-spring-web-mvc/)
    - Added by [Nic Munroe][contrib_nicmunroe] in pull request [#44](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/wingtips/pull/44).
